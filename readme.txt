Convert and serve automatically webp images with lazyload to speedup your website consistently and with zero-config.

== Description ==
* Convert images to webp on upload. uploaded files will be duplicated in the same folder with the .webp suffix (so image.jpg will become image.jpg.webp)
* Automatically serve generated webp images with lazy-loading, but if the image is missing or the browser doesn't support this feature will fallback with the original image.
